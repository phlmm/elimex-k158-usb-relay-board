# python3 based control for k158 elimex relay board (4 relays)
* Based on https://slomkowski.eu/tutorials/eavesdropping-usb-and-writing-driver-in-python/
* Device k158: https://elimex.bg/product/49275-kit-k158-usb-interfeys-za-upravlenie-na-4-releta
Requires udev rule if user access is necessary.  
Could be easily modified to support all other kits since the control byte is bitfield.
